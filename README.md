Reading Challenge 2015
-------------------------

It's no secret that reading is an important addition to any and every person's day.
This year, make it a part of yours.
Once you join, you'll find a set of book types to read.

A book you started but never finished.
A book that came out the year you were born.
A book written by an author with your same initials.
A book written by someone under 30.
Plus moooooore.

Learn more about <strong>yourself</strong> and the <strong>world</strong> around you as you immerse yourself in 50 new stories all year.<br><br>
